# cyber_leadership_slide_examples

I created these because I think as an industry we are sometimes shockingly bad at providig business context and relevence. There's alot of focus on cyber solutions and cybe as a COST. There's not enough discussion around cyber as a value enabler.

Feel free to use these to help you (or not) but please include credit/reference.

Hack for good! may the cyber force be with you! x
